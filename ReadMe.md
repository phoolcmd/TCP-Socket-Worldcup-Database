Project Creators: Bailey Seyller & Noah Wood

This project is a very basic multithreaded TCP socket database, with two applications.

First compile and run ServerApplication, and then run ClientApplication both located in "src/main/java/edu/ucdenver/app".

Currently the UI is not very pretty and there are some exception handling issues and bugs if things aren't added properly.
