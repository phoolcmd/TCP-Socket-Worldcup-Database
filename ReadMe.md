Project Creators: Bailey Seyller & Noah Wood

This project is a very basic multithreaded TCP socket database, with two applications.

First compile and run ServerApplication, and then run ClientApplication both located in "src/main/java/edu/ucdenver/app".

the "t.txt" file can be used in the load file tab in the ServerApplication to load up some basic player information for testing.

Currently the UI is not very pretty and there are some exception handling issues and bugs if things aren't added properly.
